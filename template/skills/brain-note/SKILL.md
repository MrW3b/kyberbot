# Brain Note

Persists structured, long-form knowledge to the `brain/` directory. While the `remember` skill captures individual facts and events into the timeline and entity graph, `brain-note` is for richer content that benefits from being a readable document — architecture decisions, research findings, meeting notes, reference material, project context.

## When to Fire

**Always write a brain note when:**
- The user shares or discusses an architecture or design decision with rationale
- Research findings or analysis results come up that should be referenced later
- Detailed meeting notes are shared (beyond what a single `remember` call captures)
- The user provides reference material, specs, or documentation to retain
- A complex topic is discussed that warrants a structured writeup
- Project context or onboarding information is shared
- The user explicitly asks to document or write something down

**Don't write a brain note for:**
- Single facts or events — use `remember` instead
- Information about the user — update USER.md instead
- Information about the agent's identity — update SOUL.md instead
- Recurring task definitions — update HEARTBEAT.md instead

## How to Write

### Step 1: Choose the Right File

Organize brain notes by topic. Use descriptive filenames in kebab-case:

```
brain/project-dashboard-redesign.md
brain/architecture-decisions.md
brain/meeting-notes-2025-02.md
brain/reference-api-endpoints.md
```

If a relevant file already exists, **append** to it rather than creating a new one. Check first:
```bash
ls brain/
```

### Step 2: Write the Note

Use clear markdown with dates and context. Every note should be understandable on its own — a future session reading it should immediately grasp the content without needing the original conversation.

Structure for **decisions**:
```markdown
## [Decision Title] — [Date]

**Context**: [Why this decision was needed]
**Decision**: [What was decided]
**Rationale**: [Why this option was chosen]
**Alternatives considered**: [What else was evaluated]
**Implications**: [What this means going forward]
```

Structure for **meeting notes**:
```markdown
## [Meeting Title] — [Date]

**Attendees**: [Who was there]
**Summary**: [Key points]
**Decisions**: [What was decided]
**Action items**: [What needs to happen next]
```

Structure for **research/reference**:
```markdown
## [Topic] — [Date]

[Findings, analysis, or reference material organized with clear headings]
```

### Step 3: Index It

After writing, index the full note into Kybernesis Local (ChromaDB) so the content is discoverable via semantic search, then store a summary pointer in the timeline and entity graph:

```bash
# Embed the full note content into ChromaDB
kyberbot brain add brain/[filename].md --title "[descriptive title]" --type note

# Store a summary pointer in timeline + entity graph
kyberbot remember "Brain note: [brief description of what was documented]" --response "[one-line summary of key content]"
```

Both steps are required — `brain add` makes the full content searchable by meaning, `remember` makes it discoverable in the timeline and entity graph.

### Step 4: Confirm

Tell the user where the note was saved: "Documented in brain/[filename].md"

## Examples

**Architecture decision discussed:**
```
brain/architecture-decisions.md (append):

## Frontend Framework Choice — 2025-02-23

**Context**: Needed to choose a framework for the new dashboard
**Decision**: Next.js with App Router
**Rationale**: SSR support, team familiarity, strong ecosystem
**Alternatives considered**: Remix (less mature), SvelteKit (team unfamiliar)
**Implications**: Lock into React ecosystem, need to learn App Router patterns
```

**Research findings shared:**
```
brain/kubernetes-migration.md (new file):

# Kubernetes Migration Research — 2025-02-23

## Current State
Running on bare EC2 instances with manual deploys...

## Findings

```

## Notes

- Brain notes are fully indexed in Kybernesis Local — the content is embedded in ChromaDB (via `brain add`) and the summary is stored in the timeline and entity graph (via `remember`).
- Notes are searchable via `kyberbot search`, `kyberbot brain query`, and `kyberbot brain search`.
- Use `remember` for the event/fact stream, `brain-note` for the knowledge base. They complement each other.
- Keep files focused. One file per project or topic area is better than one giant file.
- Always include dates so future sessions know when information was captured.
