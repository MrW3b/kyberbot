# Backup

Backs up the complete agent state to the configured private GitHub repository.

## When to Fire

- User says "backup", "back up", "push to github", "snapshot", "save everything"
- Heartbeat automated backup task
- Before any risky operation (major upgrades, migrations)
- After significant memory or skill updates

## What Gets Backed Up

| Data | Location | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Identity | SOUL.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md, identity.yaml | Agent personality and config |
| Skills | skills/ | All skill definitions |
| Brain notes | brain/ | Knowledge base documents |
| SQLite DBs | data/*.db (entity graph, timeline, sleep, messages) | Structured memory |
| ChromaDB | data/chromadb/ | Vector embeddings for semantic search |
| Claude Code memory | data/claude-memory/ (synced from ~/.claude) | Claude Code project memory |
| Config | docker-compose.yml, .claude/, .gitignore | Infrastructure config |

## How to Run

```bash
kyberbot backup run
```

This single command handles the full backup flow:
1. Checkpoints SQLite WAL files (merges uncommitted writes into .db files)
2. Syncs Claude Code memory files into the repo
3. Commits all changes with a timestamped message
4. Pushes to the configured GitHub remote

To verify backup integrity:
```bash
kyberbot backup verify
```

To check backup status:
```bash
kyberbot backup status
```

## Restore on a New Machine

1. `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2. Install KyberBot CLI (`pnpm install -g @kyberbot/cli` or build from source)
3. Install Claude Code
4. Copy `.env` manually (not in git — contains API keys)
5. Copy `data/claude-memory/*.md` to `~/.claude/projects/<agent-path>/memory/`
6. `docker-compose up -d` (starts ChromaDB with existing data in `data/chromadb/`)
7. `kyberbot` — agent is fully restored

## Notes

- `.env` is never committed (contains secrets). Keep a secure copy separately.
- `identity.yaml` may contain channel tokens — keep the repo **private**.
- SQLite WAL checkpoint is critical — without it, recent writes won't be in the .db files.
- ChromaDB data is binary but typically small (~2MB). Git handles it fine at this scale.
